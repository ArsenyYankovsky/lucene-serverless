#  Serverless Search

GRAALVM_HOME=~/.sdkman/candidates/java/21.3.1.r17-grl mvn clean install -Dquarkus.package.type=native

This project demonstrates a proof-of-concept serverless full-text search solution built with Apache Lucene and Quarkus framework.

✔️ No servers

✔️ No fixed costs

✔️ Low (250-300ms) cold starts

⚠️ Better deletion policy is required. Right now old segment files are not deleted as a simple workaround to handle concurrent reads and writes

Please note that the project is not ready for production since I haven't tested it under a prolonged load and to be honest interfaces need to be nicer.
